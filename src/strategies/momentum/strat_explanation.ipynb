    "# Trading Strategies Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides an overview of the trading strategies implemented in the momentum module of this repository. For each strategy, the key formulas and signal generation logic are explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Awesome Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy calculates the median price as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\text{median\\_price} = \\frac{\\text{high} + \\text{low}}{2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, two simple moving averages (SMAs) are computed on the median price:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **short–term SMA** (with period \\(n_{s}\\))\n",
    "- A **long–term SMA** (with period \\(n_{l}\\), where \\(n_{s} < n_{l}\\))\n",
    "\n",
    "The Awesome Oscillator (AO) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\text{AO} = \\text{SMA}_{n_{s}} - \\text{SMA}_{n_{l}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signal Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buy signal (1):** Triggered when the AO crosses upward past zero (i.e., previous AO \\(\\leq 0\\) and current AO \\(> 0\\)).\n",
    "- **Sell signal (–1):** Triggered when the AO crosses downward past zero (previous AO \\(\\geq 0\\) and current AO \\(< 0\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"long–only\" mode, the sell signals are suppressed (converted to 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal **strength** is the normalized absolute AO value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\frac{|\\text{AO}|}{\\max(|\\text{AO}|) + \\epsilon}, \\quad \\epsilon = 1e^{-6}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Coppock Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROC Calculation:**\\\n",
    "Two rates–of–change (ROC) are computed from the closing price using different lookback periods (in days estimated from input months):\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "ROC1 = 100 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Close}}{\\text{Close}_{\\text{lagged by }\\,\\text{roc1\\_days}}} - 1\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "ROC2 = 100 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Close}}{\\text{Close}_{\\text{lagged by }\\,\\text{roc2\\_days}}} - 1\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combined ROC and Smoothing:**\\\n",
    "The two ROC values are summed, and the combined series is smoothed using a weighted moving average (WMA) with linearly increasing weights. Mathematically, if the weights are \\(w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_N\\) (with \\(w_i = i\\)), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\text{WMA} = \\frac{w_1 \\times x_1 + w_2 \\times x_2 + \\cdots + w_N \\times x_N}{w_1 + w_2 + \\cdots + w_N}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signal Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **long signal** (+1) is generated when — after a sustained negative regime (e.g., 4 consecutive days with negative Coppock Curve values) — the indicator crosses above zero.\n",
    "- A **short signal** (–1) is triggered when, after a sustained positive regime, the indicator turns negative.\n",
    "- Additionally, a momentum strength metric is computed as the divergence between the Coppock Curve and a short–term reference (its 21-day moving average), with an optional normalization to the \\([-1, 1]\\) range.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Know Sure Thing (KST)\n",
    "\n",
    "The KST indicator is computed as the sum of several weighted moving averages of the rate–of–change (ROC) of the close price. In detail, for each ROC component:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\text{ROC}(t; \\text{period}) = \\left(\\frac{\\text{close}_t - \\text{close}_{t-\\text{period}}}{\\text{close}_{t-\\text{period}}}\\right) \\times 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smoothed ROC:**\\\n",
    "  The above ROC is smoothed using a simple moving average (SMA) over a specified period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **KST Indicator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\text{KST}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i \\times \\text{SMA}\\Big( \\text{ROC}\\big(\\text{close}, \\text{roc\\_period}_{i}\\big), \\text{sma\\_period}_{i}\\Big)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal Line:**\\\n",
    "  Computed as the SMA of the KST indicator over a given signal period.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bullish crossover (KST crossing above its signal line) triggers a long signal (or entry), while a bearish crossover triggers an exit (or a short signal if short positions are allowed). In long‑only mode, bearish crossovers lead only to exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. MACD Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fast EMA and Slow EMA:**\\\n",
    "  The fast EMA (with span = `fast`) and the slow EMA (with span = `slow`) are computed on the close price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MACD Line:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\text{MACD} = \\text{fast\\_ema} - \\text{slow\\_ema}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal Line:**\\\n",
    "  Calculated as an EMA of the MACD line over a specified smoothing period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Histogram:**\\\n",
    "  The difference between the MACD line and the signal line indicates the strength and direction of the momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signal Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A crossover upward (MACD crossing above the signal line) generates a bullish signal (+1).\n",
    "- A crossover downward generates a bearish signal (–1) if not in long‑only mode (or 0 if long‑only).\n",
