    "# ATR Trailing Stops Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The ATR Trailing Stops strategy is a volatility-based trend following system that uses Average True Range (ATR) to set dynamic trailing stop levels. This approach adapts to changing market conditions by adjusting stop distances based on recent price volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. ATR Calculation\n",
    "The Average True Range measures market volatility by calculating the greatest of:\n",
    "- Current high minus current low\n",
    "- Absolute value of current high minus previous close\n",
    "- Absolute value of current low minus previous close\n",
    "\n",
    "$$TR = \\max(High - Low, |High - PrevClose|, |Low - PrevClose|)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ATR is then calculated using an exponential moving average with smoothing factor $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{ATR_{period}}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ATR = EMA(TR, \\alpha)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Trend Determination\n",
    "A Simple Moving Average (SMA) acts as a trend filter:\n",
    "- Uptrend: $Close > SMA_{trend\\_period}$ (favorable for long positions)\n",
    "- Downtrend: $Close < SMA_{trend\\_period}$ (favorable for short positions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Trailing Stop Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "For long positions:\n",
    "- Entry triggered when trend turns up\n",
    "- Initial stop distance: $ATR \\times ATR_{multiplier}$\n",
    "- Trailing stop: $TrailingStop_{long} = Close - (ATR \\times ATR_{multiplier})$\n",
    "- Updated stop (ratcheting up): $TrailingStop_{long,t} = \\max(TrailingStop_{long,t-1}, Close_t - (ATR_t \\times ATR_{multiplier}))$\n",
    "- Exit when: $Low_t \\leq TrailingStop_{long,t-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For short positions:\n",
    "- Entry triggered when trend turns down\n",
    "- Initial stop distance: $ATR \\times ATR_{multiplier}$\n",
    "- Trailing stop: $TrailingStop_{short} = Close + (ATR \\times ATR_{multiplier})$\n",
    "- Updated stop (ratcheting down): $TrailingStop_{short,t} = \\min(TrailingStop_{short,t-1}, Close_t + (ATR_t \\times ATR_{multiplier}))$\n",
    "- Exit when: $High_t \\geq TrailingStop_{short,t-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Signal Generation\n",
    "- Buy signal (1): New long position initiated\n",
    "- Sell signal (-1): New short position initiated\n",
    "- Exit signal (0): Trailing stop breached\n",
    "- Signal strength: Normalized distance between price and trailing stop\n",

    "# Bollinger Bands Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bollinger Bands strategy implements a mean-reversion trading approach using statistical bands around a moving average to identify potential overbought and oversold conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy calculates three key components:\n",
    "1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: A rolling average of closing prices over a specified window period.\n",
    "2. **Standard Deviation (STD)**: Measures price volatility over the same window period.\n",
    "3. **Bollinger Bands**: Upper and lower bands placed at Â±*n* standard deviations from the SMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, these components are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{SMA}_t = \\frac{1}{w} \\sum_{i=t-w+1}^{t} \\text{Close}_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{STD}_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{w} \\sum_{i=t-w+1}^{t} (\\text{Close}_i - \\text{SMA}_t)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Upper Band}_t = \\text{SMA}_t + (m \\times \\text{STD}_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Lower Band}_t = \\text{SMA}_t - (m \\times \\text{STD}_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{\\%B}_t = \\frac{\\text{Close}_t - \\text{Lower Band}_t}{\\text{Upper Band}_t - \\text{Lower Band}_t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $w$ = window period\n",
    "- $m$ = standard deviation multiplier\n",
    "- $\\text{\\%B}_t$ = normalized position of price relative to the bands\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long Entry**: When price crosses below the lower band (previous close above lower band, current close below lower band)\n",
    "- **Short Entry**: When price crosses above the upper band (previous close below upper band, current close above upper band)\n",
    "- The strategy filters out duplicate consecutive signals to ensure only distinct trade entries\n",

    "## GARCH Model Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) Model Strategy is a volatility-based trading approach that generates signals based on forecasted volatility changes. The strategy employs a GARCH(1,1) model to predict future volatility and compares it with historical volatility to determine trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Returns Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Log returns: $r_t = 100 \\times \\ln(P_t / P_{t-1})$\n",
    "   - Simple returns: $r_t = 100 \\times (P_t / P_{t-1} - 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GARCH Model**:\n",
    "   - The GARCH(1,1) model forecasts conditional variance: $\\sigma_t^2 = \\omega + \\alpha \\cdot r_{t-1}^2 + \\beta \\cdot \\sigma_{t-1}^2$\n",
    "   - A rolling window of size $N$ is used to fit the model\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Volatility Comparison**:\n",
    "   - Forecasted volatility: $\\text{forecast\\_vol} = \\sqrt{\\text{forecast\\_variance}}$\n",
    "   - Historical volatility: $\\text{hist\\_vol} = \\text{std}(\\text{window\\_returns}) \\times \\sqrt{252}$\n",
    "   - Relative volatility change: $\\text{vol\\_change} = \\frac{\\text{forecast\\_vol} - \\text{hist\\_vol}}{\\text{hist\\_vol}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Signal Generation**:\n",
    "   - If $\\text{vol\\_change} > \\text{vol\\_threshold} \\Rightarrow \\text{signal} = 1$ (buy)\n",
    "   - If $\\text{vol\\_change} < -\\text{vol\\_threshold} \\Rightarrow \\text{signal} = -1$ (sell)\n",
    "   - Otherwise $\\text{signal} = 0$ (hold)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Signal Strength**:\n",
    "   - $\\text{signal\\_strength} = \\frac{|\\text{vol\\_change}|}{\\text{rolling\\_std}(\\text{vol\\_change}) + \\epsilon}$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Risk Management**:\n",
    "   - Positions are adjusted based on stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing stop rules\n",
    "   - Transaction costs and slippage are accounted for\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trading Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy is based on the principle that significant changes in forecasted volatility provide profitable trading opportunities:\n",
    "- Rising volatility (positive vol_change) may indicate upcoming market movement, triggering long positions\n",
    "- Falling volatility (negative vol_change) may signal potential reversals, triggering short positions\n",
    "- The long_only parameter restricts trading to long positions if set to True\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "The Supertrend indicator is a trend-following overlay that uses volatility (ATR) to identify potential trend changes and generate trading signals. It plots a line above or below the price based on the current trend direction, switching sides when the trend reverses.\n",
